They came down from the heavens on this blessed day<br/>
When the sky was dark and the moons alight<br/>
<!--more-->
And they brought with them a gloried Order<br/>
Into our home, our House, so humble<br/>
And the children danced in those divine few minutes<br/>
And our leaders bent their ears so kind<br/>
For it is a joyous day<br/>
A day to celebrate our Life<br/>
A day to release our Death<br/>
A day to settle our Discord<br/>
A day to enjoy our Time<br/>
A day to remember our Dream<br/>
A day that will stretch forwards a cycle until it is brought anew<br/>
Glory be to Order so kind<br/>
Let our highs be long and our lows be short<br/>
We thank You for our place at this table<br/>
Glory be to Order so kind<br/>
Let our fires burn hot and our waters run cold<br/>
We thank You for our place in this world<br/>
To this cycle come, glory be!
