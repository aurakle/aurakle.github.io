Oh we're off to a fuckin' start, ain't we?

I found out the name of the other Feyric Officer. 
Because he was an hour late to his shift. 
And Tiff had to berate him over the comms. 
Little shit, Alan's his name, slept in. 
Left me hanging.

But hey. First shift as a Feyric Officer aboard the F.A. Starcleave is over and done with. 
I'm off to bed...
