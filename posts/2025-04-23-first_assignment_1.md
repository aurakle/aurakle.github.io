First day. Can't say I'm not scared. Being assigned with Tiff is a Goddamned blessing, but the Starcleave is not a fleet ship. 
We're meant to work alone, in the deep end. Without backup. Without support. And that's fuckin' terrifying.

There's only one other Feyric Officer aboard the Starcleave. I don't know his name. I don't think I've even heard him speak. 
Though it won't matter much, we'll be working in shifts.

Our first assignment is slated to last two weeks. We're to slip into the heart of a hostile aster faction and take out their shipyard. 
During the second week, one of our fleets is to mount an assault. It is critical that the Starcleave's timing be impeccable.

No pressure, right?
