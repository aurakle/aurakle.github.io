So you've got yourself a pet ambassador. And I'm sure you're asking yourself all those questions we never quite think of until it's too late. 
What does he eat? How can I keep him entertained? Who'll take care of him when I can't?

Well, I can safely say that after a week, I know how to answer these questions. He eats identities and memories. Interpersonal conflict entertains him for days. 
And if you can't handle him, he'll make sure he's in your way.

Unfortunately, a week spent in near-constant company of the bubbly Summer fey has not tempered my patience. 
Even worse, he's currently seated across from me, rambling happily about whatever drama he overheard while walking in the city. 
I sometimes wish he'd just shut up.

Finally, there's a pause in his—dare I say—*monologue*. I take the opportunity and lean forward. He cocks his head, gold-flecked eyes widening.

"Oh! My apologies for the rambles, Delegate Arlo." His voice is as melodic as ever. "You wish to speak?"

"Thymos," I start, "why are you here?"

One of the most important parts of handling your ambassador is reminding him that he's not just a pet; he has a job, and that job is to respresent his Court. 
Because no one else can. After all, there are only four fey currently on Earth. One for each of the courts of Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring.
