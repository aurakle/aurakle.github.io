[*recording started*]

F.O. Plum: "Alright Captain, I've got shields ready."<br/>
Cap. Tiff: "Ay. Nav, how many in this system?"<br/>
Nav. Dana: "We've got one scout, on approach."<br/>
Cap. Tiff: "Pilot. Keep us on course. Plum, I'm going to need a cloak."<br/>
Pil. Borsa: "Ay Captain."<br/>
F.O. Plum: "Cloak is up."<br/>
Cap. Tiff: "Gunners, hold your fire."<br/>
Gun. Kol: "Affirmative."<br/>
Gun. Vesa: "Copy that."<br/>
Nav. Dana: "It's closing in. Firing range in five... four... three... two... one..."<br/>
Cap. Tiff: "Plum, shield up! Gunners, fire at will!"<br/>
Nav. Dana: "Its deflectors are up! No hits to the hull, it's turning around! It's heading for the rails..."<br/>
Cap. Tiff: "We can't let it leave the system. Plum, I'm going to need a portal on those rails ASAP."<br/>
F.O. Plum: "Crossways portal is open."<br/>
Cap. Tiff: "Once we're through, hit the rails first."

[*audio crackling*]

Gun. Vesa: "Rails starboard, opening fire."<br/>
Nav. Dana: "They're no longer operational, Captain. The scout is sitting still and has hailed us."<br/>
Cap. Tiff: "Put them through."<br/>
Aster Scout Ship: "Humans... I know you can understand me, with those little fairy worms in your fragile heads. I've brought no harm to you. Why do you cause such trouble?"<br/>
Cap. Tiff: "This is Captain Tiff of the F.A. Starcleave. You have two options. Board our ship as a prisoner, or sink with yours."<br/>
Aster Scout Ship: "I am not fond of that choice."<br/>
Nav. Dana: "Connection closed. It's trying to flee."<br/>
Cap. Tiff: "Chase it down and blow it to bits. Plum, forward shield up."<br/>
F.O. Plum: "Holding strong, Captain."<br/>
Nav. Dana: "In range!"<br/>
Gun. Kol: "Firing!"<br/>
Nav. Dana: "Enemy hull is hit. It's dead in the water."<br/>
Cap. Tiff: "Ay. Pilot, move us away from the wreckage. And then we can all take a good rest before heading on."
