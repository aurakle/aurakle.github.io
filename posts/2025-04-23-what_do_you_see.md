What do you see, when you look at me?<br/>
I know you cannot understand me<br/>
I know you have not lived what I've lived<br/>
So what do you see?<br/>
<!--more-->
<br/>There is a silent wail within me<br/>
Every time you look upon my face<br/>
For I know the gentle waves below<br/>
Are something you will never meet<br/>
So tell me, what do you see?<br/>
<br/>My spirit bleeds into my work<br/>
But that is not what you behold<br/>
My mind is sharp and splintered<br/>
But that is not what I put forth<br/>
My soul is torn and worn<br/>
But what does it matter<br/>
***When you won't tell me what you see?***
