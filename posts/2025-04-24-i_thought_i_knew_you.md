I thought I knew you<br/>
I wanted to trust<br/>
To hold<br/>
To reassure<br/>
<!--more-->
<br/>I thought I knew you<br/>
But all that time<br/>
And you couldn't tell me<br/>
And you wouldn't share<br/>
I had to tear out the truth<br/>
<br/>I thought I knew you<br/>
But your words are hollow now<br/>
And your actions are a roaring storm<br/>
I had to bring these walls back up<br/>
<br/>I don't know you<br/>
But I wish I could<br/>
Even still, as you walk away<br/>
I want to know you
