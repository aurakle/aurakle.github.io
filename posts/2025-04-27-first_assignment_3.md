We dropped into a system with an aster presence today. 
Right on the border of Terran space. 
Thankfully, Alan was charged with opening the crossways portal, 
so I was well-rested and just starting my shift when we came across an aster scout.

I've attached the relevant recordings for the encounter, starting from the moment I took my post. 
Can't be arsed to write it down all over again.
