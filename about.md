### English

This Starwatch is my bulwark of thought. But perhaps you wish to know who *I* am. The answer to that question is complex, but I shall do my best to explain.

I am often referred to by the following common identifiers: Aurora, Aura, and Auri. I am also jokingly referred to as Aur by some folks. 
My pronouns are they/she/it and I appreciate when they are used in tandem. I am a Canadian transgender woman and *not*-woman with a particular love for writing, programming, and reading. 
If the mood strikes me, I also enjoy playing a variety of games. I speak primarily English but I can also speak day-to-day French if necessary. As a hobby, I am also learning Toki Pona.

A proud [NixOS](https://nixos.org), [Neovim](https://neovim.io), and [i3](https://i3wm.org) user, I refuse to touch Windows unless I absolutely must.
