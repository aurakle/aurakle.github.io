Heya! I've got some <span class="wobbly">sillies</span> around here. You can [get acquainted](/about.html), take a look at some of my [writings](/writings.html), learn about my current and past [projects](/projects.html), or [get in touch](/contact.html) with me! I'm only a little shy.

If you use [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org) or a similar extension, consider disabling it. It's already dark here!
